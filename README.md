# devops-test

In this project I have created 3 Dockerfiles, 1 docker compose file and 1 Jenkins file.

The above mentioned files will help to run the MTWA software as containers over docker environment.

1. Dockerfile_appserver : This file is used to install Apche2 as the app server. Here we have used "ubuntu" as the base image.
